# MyGLuaScriptsForSCPRP 
These are scripts that were written for my project. You can use them to template your scripts. With this use, make a link to the original pls.
I left comments in all scripts to make it easier for you to change/understand the script. 
If you have any questions for me, then follow this link to my social networks : https://tapy.me/vechniyrabotnik

List of scripts:
