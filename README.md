# MyGLuaScriptsForSCPRP 
These are scripts that were written for my project. You can use them to template your scripts. With this use, make a link to the original.

List of scripts:
1) SWEP For Alpha-1 Specialist (When you click on the mouse button, you become invisible with a notification)
2) SWEP For SCP-131 (SWEP makes a sound and has a hud)
